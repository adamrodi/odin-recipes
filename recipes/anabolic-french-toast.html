    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl add 120 grams of egg whites (four egg whites), 15 grams of protein powder, and however much cinnamon, vanilla extract, and artificial sweetener that you like.</li>
            <li>Stir until fully combined with no visible clumps. Now is a good time to heat the pan. Use one that can fit all of your bread flat on the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Take out 2 pieces of bread to be dipped in the mixture with a plate to put the bread on after.</li>
            <li>Place one slice of bread in the mixture at a time allowing it to fully absorb as much of the mixture as possible. (For max protein per slice)</li>
            <li>Once all slices of bread are ready, spray the pre-heated and place the uncooked french toast flat along the bottom so it cooks evenly.</li>
            <li>Flip the frech toast as needed, until it is fully cooked on both sides and in the center.</li>
            <li>Plate and enjoy with low calorie syrup, peanut butter, berries, bananas or any other toppings that you like.</li>

        </ol>
